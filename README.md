# Random Projects
## Description

This repository contains some random programming projects.

## Chance Cube

A Chance Cube in Clojure in which it can have many sides with a different area for each.
To use the Chance Cube just open the project in EMACS, then 'cider-jack-in' then load the
file with 'C-c C-l' and type in '(-main)' in the REPL.'

## Future

I will be adding in more random projects as I clean up my computer.
